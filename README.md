# AlgoStrategy
Welcome to my repo to stash my algorithmic strategy stuff + practicing C++ (because I haven't had any experience with it :D)

Most of the stuffs you'd see here are adapted from class resources, some personal comments (written in Bahasa) and methods, and GeeksForGeeks.

Some source codes would also include instantaneous recommendations from GitHub Copilot (thanks Copilot) and will be disabled unless needed.

Note that the header libraries included are `<bits/stdc++.h` (due to my unfamiliarity) and will take longer to compile.
